//! How far past its face an offset face's surface must reach for the offsets of its
//! neighbours to meet its own: the margin the offset executive extends each surface by before
//! it intersects the offsets (not upstream: upstream extends every surface by five offset
//! distances).
//!
//! At a point `p` of an edge between a face `F` (unit normal `nF`, binormal `bF` into `F`,
//! offset `dF`) and its neighbour `G` (unit normal `nG`, offset `dG`), `c = nF·nG`, the
//! offsets' tangent planes `(x − p)·nF = dF` and `(x − p)·nG = dG` meet on the line through
//! `p + a nF + β nG`, `a + β c = dF`, `a c + β = dG`. Its foot on `F`'s tangent plane lies
//! past the edge (along the outward binormal `m = −bF`) by the edge's signed reach
//!
//! ```text
//! r = β (nG·m),   β = (dG − c dF) / (1 − c²)   ( = d / (1 + c) where dF = dG = d ),
//! ```
//!
//! `d·cot(α / 2)` for equal offsets, `α` the sector angle of the solid between the faces:
//! `d` across a box's edge, `0` across a tangent edge, negative where the offsets meet inside
//! `F`. At a vertex where `F`'s edge uses meet with reaches `r1`, `r2` and outward binormals
//! `m1`, `m2`, the offset corner's foot `x` on the tangent plane solves `x·m1 = r1`,
//! `x·m2 = r2`, at `|x|` from the vertex.
//!
//! Each foot is within `|r|` (`|x|` at a corner) of a point of the face, so within that of the
//! face's surface's box, however far the meeting runs along the face: an inward meeting that
//! leaves the face across another of its edges (a hole's offset growing past a side) is held
//! as well as an outward one. The reach of a face is the largest of these, sampled along each
//! edge (its sector angle varies) and at each corner. Faces whose offsets never meet, a knife
//! edge's (`c = −1` for equal offsets) or tangent faces offset apart (`c = 1`, `dF ≠ dG`),
//! add nothing: no extension makes them meet.
//!
//! An extension meets its distance at the middle of each side, and a reach is needed at every
//! station. [`shortest_across`] bounds the length across a B-spline's sides from below, for
//! the executive to ask again where the rows narrow along a side (#2908; the measurements and
//! the choice of asking again are `MarkusReichart`'s on #2926). Analytic faces are left as
//! they were.
