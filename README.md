![SolidCraft: model a Raspberry Pi 4 case from an empty design: a sketch dimensioned with parameters, extrude, fillets and shell, a rim rounded in one pick, standoffs patterned on the board's mounting holes, port cut-outs, vent slots, "Pi 4" engraved in a font, a PETG material with its mass in Properties, and a height change in Parameters](docs/screenshots/demo.gif)

*A Raspberry Pi 4 case from an empty design: a sketch dimensioned with the board's parameters, extrude, fillet, shell, the rim rounded in one pick, an M2.5 standoff patterned on the 58 × 49 mm hole rectangle, port cut-outs, vent slots, "Pi 4" engraved in DejaVu Sans Bold and a PETG material defined in the design, with its mass in Properties, then height 24 → 32 mm in Parameters and it all rebuilds. 6× playback with the idle pauses cut. [Full video](https://github.com/tangency-labs/solidcraft/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/screenshots/demo.mp4), recorded with the [demo script](examples/demo/record_ui.sh).*

## Download

- **Windows:** the [installer][windows-msi].
- **macOS:** the [disk image][macos-dmg] (Apple silicon and Intel).
- **Linux:** the [AppImage][linux-appimage], or `sudo snap install solidcraft` ([Snap Store][snap-store]).
- **Web:** [try it in your browser][web-app], no install.

ARM64 and 32-bit builds, portable zip, .deb, .rpm, Flatpak and the other packages are on the
[downloads page](docs/downloads.md). The macOS app is signed with a Developer ID and notarized by
Apple. The Windows downloads aren't signed yet: choose **More info**, then **Run anyway** in
SmartScreen. On SolidCraft 0.11 to 0.14, download once by hand; see
[updating](https://docs.solidcraft.io/guide/updates.html#updating-from-011-to-014).

## What works

Early but usable for simple parts: 75 of 76 public reference parts match their analytic or
FreeCAD-computed volume, area, centre of mass and bounding box ([oracle](docs/oracle.md)); the
other is a tracked bug.

- **Sketches and constraints:** lines, arcs, splines, text and more, solved by our own constraint solver, with parameter-driven dimensions.
- **Features:** extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, fillet, chamfer, shell, draft, holes, threads, patterns, mirror, split and combine on an editable parametric timeline.
- **Parameters and configurations** with unit-aware expressions.
- **Assemblies** with joints, motion studies, contact sets, interference and mass properties.
- **Sheet metal** with flanges, hems, fold/unfold and flat patterns, and plastic enclosure features.
- **Files:** STEP, IGES, 3MF, STL, OBJ and glTF in and out where supported, URDF export, `.sc` designs (`.solidcraft` files from earlier releases still open).
- **Desktop app, browser app, headless CLI and MCP server**, all running the same commands.

The full list is in [docs/capabilities.md](docs/capabilities.md) and [docs/features.md](docs/features.md);
status and plans are in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). See also [what people built](docs/showcase.md),
[3D mouse support](docs/3d-mouse.md) and the [architecture](docs/architecture.md).

## Build from source

```sh
cargo run --release -p solidcraft -- --sample      # desktop app with a sample part
cargo run --release -p solidcraft-cli -- commands  # the command registry
cargo run --release -p solidcraft-cli -- run examples/bracket.json --out bracket.step
cargo xtask ci                                     # fmt, clippy, tests, icons, assets, layers, wasm
```

More commands, the Windows cross-build and the browser build are in [docs/building.md](docs/building.md).

## AI agents (MCP)

`solidcraft-cli mcp` is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server. Headless it
runs its own design session, or with `--connect` it drives the running app so you can watch.
Claude Code: `claude mcp add solidcraft -- solidcraft-cli mcp`. If a terminal doesn't find
`solidcraft-cli` (older Windows installers don't put it on `PATH`), give its full path (by default
`"C:\\Program Files\\SolidCraft\\solidcraft-cli.exe"`). Tools, access rules and an example session:
[docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).

## Scripts

A script is a JSON list of the same commands the UI runs, executed with `solidcraft-cli run`.
Format and example: [docs/scripts.md](docs/scripts.md). Pages can also be driven through the
[browser command API](docs/browser-api.md).
