//! Why a surface routine fails, in solidcore's terms.
//!
//! Upstream: none. These describe failures of the surface routines (`crate::surface`: the
//! surface kinds' evaluation, inversion, solvers, trimming, conversion and approximation,
//! their caches, and the volume and deformation surfaces). Each also records, for difftest
//! only, the status the C++ reports for it (crate-private `comparison_status`, read through
//! [`crate::SolidError::sm_status`]).
//!
//! | Rust                               | Status difftest compares       |
//! |------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
//! | [`SurfaceFailure::Failed`]         | `SM_ERR`                       |
//! | [`SurfaceFailure::Missing`]        | `SM_ERR_NULL_POINTER`          |
//! | [`SurfaceFailure::InvalidValue`]   | `SM_ERR_INVALID_INPUT`         |
//! | [`SurfaceFailure::OutsideDomain`]  | `SM_ERR_OUTSIDE_OF_DOMAIN`     |
//! | [`SurfaceFailure::OffSurface`]     | `SM_ERR_NOT_WITHIN_TOLERANCE`  |
//!
//! Deviations: not upstream. A failure says in a phrase what went wrong; the failure's
//! `operation` path says which routine. A failure names an entity only where the site it
//! replaces named one (a blend face whose net fails its re-certification). The failures that are checks of a caller's arguments stay
//! [`crate::SolidError::InvalidInput`]. Only part of `crate::surface` uses these yet; the
//! files that still build bare statuses are listed in this module's ratchet test.
