//! Deviations: option accessors are public fields; the context-only constructor's
//! already-created intersector is supplied by its owner (its type belongs to
//! `boolean.topology_intersector_p1`). Mate maps and notification records are
//! borrowed explicitly; edge/vertex mate storage is co-ported in
//! `boolean::topology_intersector::p1` and shared mutably with `merge_p5`. B-rep
//! edge/shell traversal uses `topology::brep::p1` (`GetEdges`, `GetShells`; the
//! latter still stops at `SmRegion::GetShells`, unit `topology.shell`).
//! Region propagation takes refs and
//! their `IsVoid` results and source-list callback handles, because arena regions
//! do not yet carry shell state.
//! Missing topology mutations and point classification return
//! Unported at the first call reached. The temporary transform waits on B-rep
//! bounding boxes before any mutation; no translation is faked. Destruction is
//! Rust ownership; the temporary-transform token is restored explicitly after the
//! caller's complete scope, including error exits. Cooperative cancellation propagates
//! through ignored-status helpers. There is no input-dependent recursion.
//! `BooleanPostProcess`'s `DeleteTopologicalVertex` runs without the caller's
//! notification identities, so the survivor edge's joined curve comes back owned under
//! a kernel-issued identity of that edge; the owner identity the curve of each
//! surviving edge had before the call is put back (upstream the owner is the same
//! `SmEdge*`), so the caller's identity-keyed walks (the temporary transform's inverse
//! `Transform`) still find the curve.
//! Opt-in `Kernel::fixes.boolean_cleanup_removes_slits` (WR-304, #1120): after each
//! edge removal `boolean_post_process` also checks the merged face's edges that have
//! it on both sides (slits), skipping any a later removal deleted.
//! Opt-in `Kernel::fixes.fillet_cleanup_keeps_target_faces` (WR-459, #423): the edges
//! whose faces are all in `CleanupRelations::kept_faces` stay.
//! With that keep (WR-602, the fork's tangency-labs/smlib@cac11ea, the default since its
//! flag was retired): the kept-faces test needs two faces, so a slit (one face on both
//! sides) is checked all the same. The fork also keeps every input edge by its id; here
//! the faces alone decide, so a piece of an input edge beside a face the operation made
//! is checked as any other edge, and a face a merge makes of an input face is an input
//! face.
//! Opt-in `Kernel::fixes.cover_wraps_across_closed_seam` (WR-599, the fork's
//! tangency-labs/smlib@16bf1cb): after each face merge `boolean_post_process` runs
//! `HasSeamProblem` on the merged face and `SplitAtSeam` when a seam is crossed or missing.
//! Not upstream (WR-586, #483): the temporary origin shift's failed boxes and translations
//! propagate, a failed second translation restores the first operand, and inverse
//! transforms attempt all surviving operands before returning their first error. A
//! callback that fails may already have mutated its operand; this does not promise
//! transactionality within a transform.
//! Not upstream (#3090, WR-756): [`place_vertices_on_face_corners`] (after the boolean's
//! cleanup, a vertex more than the intersection tolerance off one of its faces moves to the
//! corner its faces define, within half its tolerance and only when that cures the gap).
