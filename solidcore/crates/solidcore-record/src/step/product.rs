//! The product structure of a STEP file (ISO 10303-41 product definitions, ISO 10303-43
//! representations, ISO 10303-44 assembly structure, ISO 10303-46 presentation) as plain data:
//! the products and their definitions, the shape representations with their items and contexts,
//! the relationships between representations (with or without a transformation), the assembly
//! occurrences, and the colours the presentation styles give items. Read from a parsed
//! [`Exchange`] by [`read`].
//!
//! Nothing is composed: an occurrence's placement is the two placements of its
//! `ITEM_DEFINED_TRANSFORMATION` (or the operator of its relationship) as the file gives them,
//! and a mapped item keeps its map's origin and its own target. Forming a placement's matrix,
//! inverting it and multiplying placements down the tree are the kernel's, sequenced by ops
//! (#2578, slice 6). Lengths are in millimetres (each times its representation context's length
//! unit, the only arithmetic here); directions keep the ratios the file writes; colours keep the
//! numbers the file writes (not clamped, not converted between linear and sRGB), and a
//! pre-defined colour's RGB comes from a fixed table of ISO 10303-46's names.
//!
//! Cross references are indices into the vectors of [`ProductStructure`], each vector in entity
//! id order. Bodies and the items a style colours are referred to by their entity ids: their
//! topology is read elsewhere (#2578, slice 2d).
//!
//! Input is hostile: every reference the structure follows must exist and be of the expected
//! kind, an assembly or a chain of mapped items may nest at most [`MAX_ASSEMBLY_DEPTH`] deep and
//! may not cycle, and expanding the assembly tree ([`ProductStructure::instances`]) stops with an
//! error past [`MAX_VISITS`] instances. Reading is linear in the file: a sub-assembly shared at
//! every level is read once, and only its expansion grows with its uses. Nothing is
//! pre-allocated from a count in the file, and every error is a message, never a panic.
//!
//! Origin: the data walk of SolidCraft's `crates/kernel/src/step_in/mod.rs` at `a5b71ca2` (MIT
//! OR Apache-2.0): `representation`, `Reader::index`, `find_colour`, `find_transparency`,
//! `placement_matrix` (its reading), `mapped_targets`, `occurrence_name`, `product_name`,
//! `occurrence_matrix` (its reading), `node` (its walk), `part_name`, and the root rule of
//! `StepReading::with_workers`.
//!
//! Deviations from SolidCraft, none with a geometric computation in its place:
//! - Placements are data ([`Frame`]), not matrices: `frame_matrix`, `mat_mul`, `linear_det`,
//!   `placement_inverse` and the operator's determinant check are the kernel's (slice 6); an
//!   operator's scale is refused here only when it is zero or not a number (was: also a singular
//!   operator).
//! - A cycle in the assembly or in mapped items, nesting past [`MAX_ASSEMBLY_DEPTH`] (the same
//!   bound: 33 levels, the root at depth 0) and a reference the structure follows that is missing
//!   or of the wrong kind are refused with a message (were: a warning, the rest left out). An
//!   occurrence of a definition in itself is a cycle (was: skipped).
//! - [`MAX_VISITS`] bounds [`ProductStructure::instances`] (was: the occurrences and mapped
//!   representations the import walked, the rest left out with a warning). Reading itself
//!   visits each definition and representation once. `MAX_BODIES`, `MAX_WINDOW` and
//!   `MAX_CLOSURE_WORK` bound the bodies built and their conversion, which are ops' (slice 6).
//! - Colours are kept per style ([`StyledItem`]): every surface style with its side, fill
//!   colour, rendering colour and transparency, and every curve style's colour (was: the first
//!   colour a bounded search of up to 64 entities reached from the style list, and the first
//!   transparency, as `f32`, clamped to 0..1, opacity `1 - t`). An unknown pre-defined colour
//!   keeps its name and no RGB (was: white). Choosing one colour per body or face is ops'.
//! - Names are kept as the file gives them, escapes decoded by [`super::p21`] (were: trimmed,
//!   with fallbacks: the product's id for an empty name, "Import" for none, an occurrence's id).
//! - A relationship between representations that is a complex instance without a
//!   transformation is kept as a plain link (was: ignored).
//! - A `PRODUCT_DEFINITION_WITH_ASSOCIATED_DOCUMENTS` is a definition like a
//!   `PRODUCT_DEFINITION`, and a root when no occurrence uses it (was: never a root, so its
//!   bodies came in outside the tree). A `DRAUGHTING_MODEL` a relationship names is a
//!   representation (was: a link to nothing). A `CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_SHAPE_REPRESENTATION` of
//!   anything but an occurrence places nothing (as before; its relationship is still a link).
//! - Every map is a `BTreeMap` or a `Vec` in entity id order (were `HashMap`s); doc comments on
//!   every public item. Recursion: the nesting check and the expansion carry their depth and stop
//!   past [`MAX_ASSEMBLY_DEPTH`]; a presentation style assignment is followed one level (its
//!   styles are not assignments again).
