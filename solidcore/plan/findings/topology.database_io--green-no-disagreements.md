# topology.database_io (green; no disagreements)

2059 default cases (59 fixtures over `Surface.sms`, `MakeFace/ApproximateSphere.smp`,
`Tess/Extrusion.pbp`, `Tess/BoxFillet.stl` plus edge cases, and 2000 generated scripts)
and a 200,059-case run (`--seeds 200000`) agree exactly with upstream, including the
stream state and read position after every step. Things later ASCII/binary reader ports
must know:

- **ASCII readers depend on libstdc++ details.** `*GetInStreamPtr() >> x` is reproduced
  by `InputStream::extract_*` (sentry, `num_get`, `strtod`): no digits gives 0 with
  `failbit`; overflow clamps (`long` to `LONG_MIN/MAX`, `unsigned long` to `ULONG_MAX`,
  `double` to `±DBL_MAX`) with `failbit`; `>> unsigned long` accepts `-n` and negates
  modulo 2^64; `>> short`/`>> int` read a `long` and clamp; a failed sentry stores
  nothing. Once `failbit` or `eofbit` is set, every later extraction and `GoToNextLine`
  does nothing; upstream readers rarely check, so later values keep their old contents.
- **`GoToNextLine` = `ignore(256, '\n')` stops after 256 bytes without consuming the
  newline.** A line of 256+ bytes from the current position is therefore not finished:
  the next read starts on the same line.
- **`ReadType` word buffers are capped at 255 bytes, but only in optimised builds.** GCC
  11+ libstdc++ bounds `operator>>(istream&, char*)` with `__builtin_object_size` under
  `__OPTIMIZE__`. Upstream is built `-O2`, so the 256-byte `sBuff` takes 255 bytes and
  leaves the rest in the stream; at `-O0` the same code overflows the buffer. The port
  caps at 255 (`extract_word_limited`). Shim code built at `-O0` doesn't have the cap.
- **Binary short reads are undefined upstream.** `ReadLong`/`ReadLongs` (`version >= 40`)
  read into uninitialised locals and return `SM_SUCCESS` with garbage when the data ends.
  The port returns `SolidError::InvalidInput`; difftest compares only the status (`-2`)
  and the stream state in those cases.
- **LP64.** `long` is 8 bytes on the reference platform, so the `version < 40` and
  `>= 40` integer paths are identical and their range checks are dead. A file written on
  LLP64 Windows with `version < 40` (4-byte longs) would not read correctly upstream
  either.
- **`ReadBoolean` never byte-swaps, `ReadBooleans` does** (upstream asymmetry, kept).
  `ByteSwap32(unsigned short)` always returns 0, but nothing reaches it when
  `sizeof(short) == 2`.
