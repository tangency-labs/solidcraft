# Findings

Rust-vs-C++ disagreements, upstream bugs, nondeterminism and other facts later agents
need. Add entries under a heading per unit (or "General"); keep the newest at the end
of each section.

## General

- **Nondeterministic upstream paths.** `SmFace::GetPointsInFace` (asked for more than one
  point) and `SmShell.cpp` call `srand(time(NULL))`. Those paths can't be reproduced bit for
  bit. Difftests must avoid them, or compare only results that don't depend on the random
  draw. The Rust port draws from `kernel.rng` instead. (Reported by Wave 0 agents B and C;
  see `plan/closure.md` for the other hazards: pointer-keyed maps, global tolerances, and
  statics set by the first call.)
- **NLib global error record.** NLib routines return a flag and store the error number in
  the process-wide `NL_ERROR.eno` (`N_ErrSet`). Shims must call `N_ErrClear()` before the
  call and read `NL_ERROR.eno` after it. On the Rust side this is
  `SolidError::Nlib { code: NlibCode, .. }` (added to `crates/solidcore/src/error.rs` with
  `nlib.knots`). Normalise both sides to `nlib_<number>` in runners.
- **JSON can't hold NaN or inf.** difftest inputs are JSON, so generated cases can't contain
  non-finite parameters (serde turns NaN into `null`). Test robustness to non-finite input in
  Rust unit tests. Outputs may still be non-finite.
- **difftest report `seeds` field.** It records the `--seeds` CLI value, not the number of
  generated cases a runner actually produced. `nlib.knots` overrides `cases()` to always
  generate at least 1200.

## nlib.knots (green; no disagreements)

2953 default cases and a 51,753-case run (`--seeds 50000`) all agree bit for bit with
upstream (`max_rel_err = 0`). Upstream behaviour worth knowing:

- **`N_BasisEval` with a flag other than `NL_LEFT`/`NL_RIGHT`.** It ignores the
  `NL_CAL_ERR` from `N_BasisFindSpan` and reads an uninitialised span index (UB). Rust
  takes a `Side` enum, so this can't happen. The ffi wrappers reject other flags.
- **Out-of-bounds reads on short knot vectors.** Upstream span and basis routines read
  outside `U` when `m < 2p+1` (and `N_BasisEval` overflows its stack arrays when
  `p > NL_MAXDEG + 1`). Rust returns `SolidError::InvalidInput` for these. The ffi wrappers
  only pass inputs with `n_knots >= 2p+2`.
- **`N_BasisEval` on `NL_NUM_ERR`.** Upstream leaves `N` partly computed. Rust returns only
  the error. A later port that relies on the partial values would need a different API.
- **NL_LEFT/NL_RIGHT docs contradict the code.** The upstream comments say `NL_LEFT` means
  `U[spn] < u <= U[spn+1]`, but the code does the opposite: `NL_LEFT` gives
  `U[spn] <= u < U[spn+1]`. Rust `Side` documents what the code does.
- **`N_KnotVectorIsValid` accepts degenerate vectors.** It accepts a vector of `p+1` equal
  knots (for example `[2,2,2,2]` with p=3), and a single knot with p=0. Rust does the same,
  faithfully.
- **Zero-length end spans are skipped.** `N_BasisFindSpan` moves the end spans inward past
  zero-length spans (`U[i+1] < U[i] + 1e-12`, upstream note [B405]). `find_span_and_mult`
  therefore reports multiplicity `p+1` at the domain ends, whatever the real end
  multiplicity is.
