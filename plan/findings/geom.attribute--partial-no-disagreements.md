# geom.attribute (partial; no disagreements)

2029 default cases (6 upstream-derived fixtures, 23 edge-case fixtures, 2000 generated
scripts) and a 200,029-case run (`--seeds 200000`): every non-deferred case agrees
exactly with upstream (ints/topology identical, doubles bit for bit). Cases whose script
runs `Merge` on an `SmMergeRegionAttribute` are deferred on `topology.shell`
(`SmRegion::GetBrep` / `IsInfiniteRegion` / `IsVoid`; 38 of the default cases). Notes for
later agents:

- **Data model.** `geom::attribute::AttributeStore` owns every attribute (append-only
  slots, `AttributeHandle`) *and* every object's attribute list, keyed by an opaque
  `ObjectKey(u64)`. Whoever ports `SmAObject` (unit `geom.a_object`) and the topology
  owners should map their ids to `ObjectKey`s (or replace the key type) and hold one
  store per B-rep or kernel. The `SmAObject` attribute-list methods
  (`AddAttribute`, `RemoveAttribute`, `ClearAttributes`, `GetAttributes`,
  `FindAttribute`) are co-ported as store methods (`// CO-PORT(geom.a_object)`);
  `SmObject::IsKindOf` (`geom.object`) closes `Attribute::is_kind_of`.
- **Wiring `topology.shell`.** `AttributeStore::merge` on a merge-region attribute calls
  the private stubs `region_brep` / `region_is_infinite` / `region_is_void`
  (`// UNPORTED(topology.shell)`). They need region data the store does not have, so the
  porter will have to pass the B-rep (or a region lookup) into `merge`. In the difftest
  the regions are bare `SmRegion`s outside any B-rep: `GetBrep()` is NULL for both,
  `IsInfiniteRegion()` FALSE, `IsVoid()` FALSE, so the added region type is always 0.
- **Upstream behaviour kept (all compared):**
  - `SmLongAttribute`, `SmVector3dAttribute` and `SmColorAttribute::MakeCopy` drop the
    behaviour (copies are `SM_AB_COPY` even from `SM_AB_STANDALONE_COPY`); the other
    classes keep it.
  - `AddAttribute` only skips the attribute when `FindAttribute(id)` returns *that*
    attribute, so a second attribute with the same id is added, and adding it again adds
    a duplicate entry and a duplicate user (`AddUser` only signals `SM_ERR`).
  - `fromClearAttributes` with exactly one user empties the user list and deletes a
    dependent attribute whoever that user is.
  - `SmMergeRegionAttribute::GetType()` is `SmPointerAttribute_TYPE`, but `IsKindOf`
    answers for `SmMergeRegionAttribute_TYPE` and not the pointer type.
    `SmColorAttribute::GetType()` is `SmVector3dAttribute_TYPE`.
  - Only `SmColorAttribute` is propagated through Booleans; an `SM_AI_COLOR`
    `SmVector3dAttribute` (what persistence and the upstream tests create) is not.
    `SmColorAttribute::PropagateRegionsThroughBooleans` copies *itself* (not the colour
    it found) onto the result when only one input has a colour; any other class's
    `PropagateRegionsThroughBooleans` runs the base `Merge`, even for merge-region
    attributes.
  - `GOTO_NEXT_ATTLINE` treats a `0xFF` byte as `EOF` (`(signed char)get()`), and fails
    with `SM_ERR` after more than 1000 bytes before the newline.
- **Upstream undefined behaviour (Rust returns `SolidError::InvalidInput`; the difftest
  skips these with status -2 on both sides):** `~SmAttribute` on a dependent attribute
  with users deletes it twice (its `RemoveAttribute` -> `RemoveUser` deletes when the last
  user goes); `~SmAttribute` with a user that does not list it leaves other lists
  dangling; `RemoveUser`/`fromClearAttributes` called directly on a listed attribute can
  leave a dangling list entry; `SmMergeRegionAttribute::Merge` dereferences NULL when
  both inputs have a merge-region attribute and the result does not, and casts any
  `SM_AI_OTHER_REGION_ID` attribute to the merge-region class; the colour average casts
  whatever `SM_AI_COLOR` attribute it finds and dereferences a NULL result colour;
  `SetRegions` writes past the "other" lists when they are shorter than the "this" list;
  `ReadIndexedAttributesFromDB` reads an uninitialised count when the ASCII stream is
  already failed or at its end, and a short binary read gives garbage; counts/indices
  near `ULONG_MAX` wrap `SetSize`. Rust caps counts and indices at 2^20.
- **Shim liveness is predicted.** Upstream gives no way to see that `RemoveUser` /
  `fromClearAttributes` / `ClearAttributes` deleted an attribute, so the shim predicts
  which script handles die from the state before the op (rule documented in
  `harness/cpp/shim/geom_attribute.cpp`); the Rust side reports its store's real
  liveness. Everything else in the dump (lists, users, values) is read back from the
  C++ objects.
